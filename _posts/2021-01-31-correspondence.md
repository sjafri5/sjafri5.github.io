How have you been Margaux? I've been listening to Miss Gurevich all morning. Still learning sad songs on the piano? Did you fix the ukelele? I miss your home in Montreal. You got me into baths, you know. I always loved the light that spilled into your home. I moved into a loft that used to be a synagogue; it also gushes with light, Margaux. There was always a lovely depth in our conversations. Miss ya, I hope you're lovely

This is lovely Raza. I haven’t had a home for over a year therefor no more piano to play on, but I move as I please and I live pretty true. I’m in New York until the end of the month then in California all September. Your new nest sounds dreamy. Light should never be underestimated. I’m glad it is overflowing you. I feel that our in depth conversations could resume as if no time has passed. Life’s long, time will come.
