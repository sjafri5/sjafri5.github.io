This is a bit late but I want to be explicit with my new years resolution for this year. 

- No cannabis for first 6 months; I can only use it up to 5 times for the last 6 months.
- I want to read 100 books this year
- I want to perform on my sitar once this year
- I want to write a post once a week
- I will meditate each night before I sleep
