Bina has a baby. She's not allowed to drink wine, apparently, even though the kid is already out and about. I guess because of the intimate relationship between mother and baby during breastfeeding the risk of alcohol still remains. This relationship is still mysterious to me. I guess it'll always be mysterious to me but I haven't even been around young mothers very much so I'm learning a lot.

Anyways, I drink a lot of wine these days. It's freeing in the evening. But I always limit myself to just a glass or a few. No one in the house was really an avid drinker (or smoker, for that matter). It was a bit of a surprise given that I was living with a bunch of German and French kids. One would imagine that beer and wine would be flowing through every spout in the house. One would imagine we'd be bathing in wine and washing each other's bodies and fucking endlessly into the morning. But no, that didn't happen. Anyways, I had bought a large box of wine for myself and ended up sharing it with everyone in the house. 

It was one of those moments where several of us were drinking wine together. Bina took Gigi's glass from her and drank it hurriedly. It was the way in she drank it that seared the moment into my mind. There was certainly caution in her; She took only a few gulps and did so quickly. But those few gulps were big. she knew she could only take a few and made each of those gulps count. She took the dark red liquid like it was cool water on a sweltering day. Just a few sips though. It was just to taste it again. After months and months of the most intense moment of her life, the act of giving birth, she just wanted the familiar burning sensation of wine to coat her mouth and her insides. It was a thirst not for water, which is a biological necessity and thus understandable to drink in such eagerness. It was for wine. It was for warmth and liberation. It was a thirst for an escape. It was a thirst for youth and its carelessness. It was for her past and for her present. It was for wine.
