My experience in Africa is interesting. This is my third great travel where I have spent a considerable amount of time in a part of the world where the culture is vastly different from my own. My time studying abroad in Europe contrasted nicely with the months I had spent backpacking through South America. It has only been a week here and I already can tell that my experience here is going to be quite different from the previous two.

This is true for several reasons. The most obvious is that I have come here to work on a project. I am in Kenya to make sure the mobile app I have built is succesfully being used and capturing data that the team needs to be succesful. Thus, both how I spend my time and who I spend it with are shaped by this agenda. I currently live in a house with several other roommates, most of which are Westerners (there is also a Russian). The house has constant security and a maid who cooks lunch and does laundry. It would be difficult for me to imagine a situation where I could be any more insulated. 

That being said my work allows me to see a more realistic version of Kenya. The purpose of our app is to track supplies through informal markets. There are an infinite number of shops and kiosks that purchase and sell products within Kenyan slums that there is no data on. What Sokowatch has done is hired a group of ten foot soldiers to move through the sprawls of the slum and sell products. These foot soldiers are young Kenyans who themselves have grown up in the slums and have very little opportunity available to them. Because it is them who will be using the app I had the opportunity to go with them into the slums and witness what life is like on a Wednesday morning in the Pipeline slum of Nairobi. We walked through mucky paths passing street vendors, livestock and people moving things from here to there. The kiosks were fascinating themeselves. Often a lady sat behind a bared up window that held commonly used items like soap, bread, toothpaste, and gum. Here I was the target of many curious eyes. My striped shirt, loosely tied long hair, and Harry Potter glasses stuck out just a bit.

Nairobi as a whole is a peculiar story. The infrastructure is not where it needs to be. The city is not well designed and traffic is horrendous. The public transport system hinges on what are known as Mutatus. A Mutatu is a privately owned bus that rampaages down the street and clogs traffic. The main meeting places seem to be a set of malls throughout the city which is irritiating because I fucking hate malls. The ones her are obviously different here but not by much. 

I have never witnessed post-colonialism first hand before. I understood the term, I have read the articles on it. But, truly, there is a glass wall between you and an idea until you stand face to face with it. There is something sublime about being in a country where the foreigners all seem to be doing quite well for themselves and the local people have no opportunities.

The city is young with 70% of the population being under 25%. This gives Nairobi a vibrancy that I like to imagine New York had in the early 1900's. There is a lot of foreign invesment in Nairobi and the large foreign population is a reflection of that.

The people I have met here are fascinating. It is immediately recognizable that a sense of generousity is innate in the people here. One can only imagine how that was taken advatage of by the British.
