## Teams

I've learned that teams are dynamic entities and that it is important to understand each others' strengths and weaknesses. It is also essential to play to each individual's strength if we want the team to succeed. Rohan undeniably has leadership qualities: he concerns himself with things that matter greatly to the team, when often no one else worries about those things. He also provides our team with a direction in terms of where we are heading. Nate is a talented salesman who has a knack for getting along with just about everyone (except smelly elli). his networking skills and expansive connections will be instrumental to our success. Jared understands financial jargon better than anyone else in the group; the way he researches topics that are important to the group, no one else cares to. Dan is simply a powerhouse not only in terms of his coding abilities but also his work ethic. As for me, i feel that my strongest qualities include bringing creative energy into the group, playing different roles both as a leader and a teammate, and connecting people, ideas and ideals.
