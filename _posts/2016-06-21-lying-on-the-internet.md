I remember where I was when I had decided to change my name of facebook to Razza Patel. THere were rumors circulating that schools were beginning to view students' social media account for evidence of illicit activity. They would use these pictures and confessions as reasons to refuse admittance. I was in my freshman year of college bathing in all of the romanticism and self-importance that the first year of college embodies. As someone who both aspired to go to medical school, I figured lets change my name on social media. I chose a variation in spelling for my first name and a common Indian surname as an attempt to be humurous.

Lying on the internet is an interesting phenomenon. My initial prespective of this name change was something foolish and funny. But quickly my personality began to grow with it. Some of my childhood friends affectionately adorned me the name 'RazP'. As my freshman year relationship began to fall apart, my lover began to ascribe my faults to Razza Patel. As stories of the surveillance state began to burst on to center stage, Razza Patel stood as a mockingly futile call for anonymity. When asked why my name was a lie, this has always been my silly reasoning. Obviously, anyone who has the motivation and the resources to find me will do so. But it was fun to talk about; it was fun to laugh at.

As my digital network grew, more and more of my connections knew me as a Patel. Since my birthday is also a mistruth on Facebook, there came a torrent of well wishers every June 10th, a day that otherwise has no significance to me.  It had made an otherwise unremarkable day in the middle of the year into one that I will forever look at with affection.

 These lies created an odd sort of joy. Whether it be my name or my birthday, it was twice the fun. These lies never escaped the internet. Whenvever asked I always admitted my page was full of mistruths. Of course, not everyone would ask and so not everyone knew. I enjoyed the fact that there was inconsistency in people's perceptions of me.
